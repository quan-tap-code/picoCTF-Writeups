Inspecting the page give us nothing if we searching for `picoCTF`. Let's look at the hints.

`Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.`

`Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.`

`What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.`

After reading the hints, we can assume that the flag is hidden somewhere in the source of the page but inspecting doesn't give us anything. But it won't be hidden in the `.html` file.

In the `Inspect` tab we could switch to the `Sources` tab we could see the `index` file. After clicking it, we could search `picoCTF` in the file and found the flag.
`picoCTF{SPOILER}`
