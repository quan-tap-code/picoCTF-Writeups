There isn't anything to do on this site except a script in the box that allow us to copy.

Usually there will be a `.js` file that run the script of the website. But there is another way to run javascript on the website.

Copy the script and `Inspect` the website.

In the `Innspetor` we see the tab `Console`. This is how we cana execute the script directly on the web.

Go to the `Console` and type 
```
allow pasting
```
This will allow pasting in the `Console`.

Next, paste the script in the `Console` and press `Enter` to execute the script which will give us the flag.
