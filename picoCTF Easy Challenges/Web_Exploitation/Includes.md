Combining the alert with the hint given by the challengee.

`Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?`

That's mean we won't find the flag in the `html`. If we go to the `Sources` tab in the `Inspector` we could see a `javascript` file and a `css` file.

We will find the flag in these two files seperated into 2 parts.
