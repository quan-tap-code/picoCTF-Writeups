Clicking con `Red` and `Blue` will change the website color. Inspecting in `DevTools` doesn't give us anything. Let's look at the hint.

`Maybe you have more than 2 choices`

`Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses`

### Solution 1: Using `burpsuite`

They suggest to use `Burpsuite`, so let's open it up. 

Using `Site map` under `Target` tab we could see that the website using `GET` method.

The challenge name is `Get aHEAD` may suggest us to use method `HEAD` instead. 

Using `Intercept` under `Proxy` tab we could do that. Turn on the `Intercept` and reload the website.

Edit the `GET` method to `HEAD` method and `Forward` to see what the website responses. Check the `Site map` again and we get the flag in the response.

### Solution 2: Using `curl`
Using `curl` in terminal we could get the website responses with `HEAD` method.
```bash
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/
```
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
flag: picoCTF{SPOILER}
Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
