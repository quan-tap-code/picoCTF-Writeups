## Solution
Opening the website they give us, we get access to this.

Inspecting the website doesn't give us anything noticeable. Let's try typing in `snickerdoodle` like they suggest and search.

We get to this website but this isn't the flag. The challenge especially mentioned `Cookies` and everything in the website does too. That's mean it must be something to do with the cookies.

### Solution 1: Using DevTools
Using DevTools we can see the cookies in the website after we entered `snickerdoodle`.

Go to `Application` tab in DevTools then go to `Storage` and find `Cookies` menu drop down. 

After that we couldd see that there is one cookie called `name` with the value of `0`.

Let's try the value to something else like `1`. Double click in the value to change it and reload the page. 

After changing the cookie we get a new text in the website.

Proceed changing the cookie value until you get the flag.

### Solution 2: Using curl and grep
We will retrieve the website using `curl` and use `grep` to retrieve the flag.
```bash
for c in {1..20}; do curl -s --cookie "name=$c" http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check | grep picoCTF ; done
```
```bash
            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{SPOILER}</code></p>
```
You can try to increase the range if you don't manage to find the flag in the first try by adjusting `{1..20}` to your desire.
