Let's try using `DevTools` to inspect the website.

We got a portion of the flag in the website `html` and `css` file.

And we have a question in the `javascript` file.

After some research about `Google Indexing` we found a file called `robots.txt`. We can get access to this file by adding `/robots.txt` at the end of the website URL.

We are greeted by another portion of the flag and another hint.

They talk about apache server and `Access` with capital `A`. After we do some more research about apache server, we found that we could access it by adding `.htaccess` at the end of the website URL.

Another portion of the flag and another hint.

They use the word `Mac` and `Store` with capital `S`. Seaching on google suggest that we should check `.DS_Store` file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d6e5ecf-7200-43c2-97c9-567fa9f97d7e)

Now we got all five parts of the flag.
