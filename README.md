# picoCTF challenges writeups
This is my writeups for [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) challenges. These are mainly my documentation, but I'm still a student, just started learning about cybersecurity not long ago, so there are still some mistakes and flaws in my writeups. And I'm not a native English speaker, so there will be some grammatical errors or spelling mistakes.

I categorized the challenges based on their difficulty. I will categorized them based on their released year in the future.

FYI I use Kali Linux with some pre-installed packages. You can use vitural machine or dual boot any linux distro.
